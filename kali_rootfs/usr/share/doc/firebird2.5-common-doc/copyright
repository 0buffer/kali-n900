Table of contents
=================

This file is long, but complete. Here's what's inside:

* How to get re-packaged upstream source
* What is removed from upstream source and why
* The easy part: files under debian/
* Upstream licensing summary
* Upstream copyright summary
* Complete list of the files in the repackaged upstream tarball, groupped by
  license and copyright holders.
* Verbatim copies of all licenses used upstream


How to get re-packaged upstream source
======================================
Run 'uscan --force' or debian/rules get-orig-source

That will download from upstream, remove what is to be removed and create
an .orig.tar.gz


What is removed from upstream source and why
============================================

* Bundled libraries

The following libraries are supplied by upstream in their source
tarball. These are present in Debian and using the Debian packages is
better because:
 - improved security: no need to watch the bundled libraries for
   security problems -- Debian Security already handles that for the
   Debian packages
 - get fixes and improvements automatically when the Debian library
   package is upgraded
 - the source tarball decreases in size from 13MB to 7.5MB (42% decrease)
Removed library sources:
 - extern/icu
 - extern/editline


* Removed sources with non-free/missing licensing

The following files are removed as they contain only copyright
information without any license allowing their distribution. Luckily,
they are not needed when building on Debiian.

 - builds/install/arch-specific/solaris/
 - src/install/arch-specific/solx86gcc/CS/postinstall.in
 - src/install/arch-specific/solx86gcc/CS/postremove.in
 - src/install/arch-specific/solx86gcc/CS/preinstall.in
 - src/msgs/templates.sql
 - extern/SfIO/

* Generated files without source

These two files are generated from SGML sources, but the sources are not in the 
upstream tarball.

 - doc/Firebird-2-QuickStart.pdf
 - doc/ReleaseNotes.pdf

* Generated files and other cruft.

Since we are repackaging, we take the opportunity to also remove the following 
files, which are generated during the build:

 - configure
 - builds/make.new/config/config.guess
 - builds/make.new/config/config.h.in
 - builds/make.new/config/config.sub
 - builds/make.new/config/install-sh
 - builds/make.new/config/ltmain.sh

Also, the following files are just cruft and are present in the upstream 
tarball by mistake:

 - .cvsignore (in several directories)
 - builds/make.new/config/config.h.in~


The easy part: files under debian/
==================================

Files: debian/qli.pod

 I hereby place the documentation I wrote for firebird debian packages in the
 public domain: debian/qli.sgml

 This means your are free to place any license on it as you like or none at all
 and leave it in the public domain.

 If it breaks you get to keep both peaces, that manual was produced by
 interpreting some source code and may be more useful for baking cookies  :)

non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale,
and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).

(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the
date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of
this License.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted:
1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the
Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the
Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other
software or devices.

2.2. Contributor Grant.

Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor
(or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination
with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of:
1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the
combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
Version (or portions of such combination).

(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the
date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted:
1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version;
2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by:
i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination
of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that
Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
of this License or a future version of this License released under Section
6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the
Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
(a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims.

If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by
such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text
file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the
claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.

If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface
and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.

(c) Representations.

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as
a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate
this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any
such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements
of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include
a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is
available under the terms of this License, including a description of how
and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the 
Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill
to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions.

Inprise Corporation (''Inprise'') may publish revised and/or new versions of
the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.
You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
subsequent version of the License published by Inprise. No one other than
Inprise has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only
do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed
by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL", 
"InterBase", "Inprise", "Borland'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not
appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this
License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape
Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

6.4 Origin of the InterBase Public License.

The InterBase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1
with the following changes:

1. The license is published by Inprise Corporation. Only Inprise Corporation
can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code.
2. The license can be modified and used for code which is not already
governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be renamed
to avoid confusion with Netscape?s or Inprise?s license and must include a
description of changes from the InterBase Public License.
3. The name of the license in Exhibit A is the "InterBase Public License".
4. The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.
5. Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.
6. Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted
7. A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and
restricted rights to use the trademarks of Inprise Corporation.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to
the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt
of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications
made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect
to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed
upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the
rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
specified above.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)
are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed,
or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end
user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by Georgia law provisions (except
to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business
in the United States of America, Any litigation relating to this License
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
District of Georgia and/or the state courts of Gwinnett County, Georgia,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
"Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of
the InterBase Public License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

EXHIBIT A - InterBase Public License.

3. Distribution Obligations.


3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which 
You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without 
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be 
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this 
License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer 
or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the 
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, 
You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described 
in Section 3.5. 


3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to 
which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the 
terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via 
an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made 
an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution 
Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the 
date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent 
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such 
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version 
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by 
a third party. 


3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to 
which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to 
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a 
prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from 
Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the 
Initial Developer in 

(a) the Source Code, and

(b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in 
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.


3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the 
rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, 
Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution 
titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim 
in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If 
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made 
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify 
the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and 
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 

(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application 
programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent 
licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 


(c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's 
Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor 
has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 


3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file 
of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source 
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location 
(such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a 
notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as 
a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this 
License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe 
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may 
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You 
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer 
or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 


3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered 
Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been 
met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source 
Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, 
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of 
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an 
Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the 
Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of 
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and hat the license 
for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights 
in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You 
offer. 


3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered 
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute 
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the 
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

    

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect 
to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You 
must: 

(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and 

(b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be 
included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with 
all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of 
ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 


5. Application of this License.

    

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 
Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 


6. Versions of the License.


6.1. New Versions. The Initial Developer of this code may publish revised 
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be 
given a distinguishing version number. 


6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under 
a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under 
the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code 
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
Initial Developer. No one other than the Initial Developer has the right to modify 
the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.


6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License 
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already 
Covered Code governed by this License), You must 

(a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', 
''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL", or any confusingly similar phrases 
do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs 
from this License) and 

(b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains 
terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public 
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or 
Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves 
be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 


6.4 Origin of the Initial Developer's Public License. The Initial Developer's 
Public License is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following 
changes: 

1) The license is published by the Initial Developer of this code. Only the 
Initial Developer can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code. 

2) The license can be modified and used for code which is not already 
governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be 
renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape's license Initial Developer's's 
license and must include a description of changes from the Initial 
Developer's Public License. 

3) The name of the license in Exhibit A is the "Initial Developer's Public 
License".

4) The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed.
 
5) Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.

6) Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted

8. TERMINATION.

    
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 
days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code 
which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. 
Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination 
of this License shall survive. 

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as 
"Participant") alleging that:

(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You 
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after 
receipt of notice You either:

(i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable 
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications 
made by such Participant, or 

(ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor 
Version against such Participant. 


If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or 
the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to 
You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the 
expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's 
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any 
rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 
2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, 
distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that 
such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent 
where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the 
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the 
licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken 
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user 
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall 
survive termination. 


9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.


UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL 
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED 
CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON 
FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF 
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY 
AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY 
SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 


10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.


The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer 
software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights 
set forth herein. 


11. MISCELLANEOUS.

any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, 
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes 
in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do 
business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, 
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for 
costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and 
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which 
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall 
not apply to this License. 


12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.


As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims 
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this 
License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute 
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be 
deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 


13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.


Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". 
"Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Devpoeloper permits you to utilize portions of 
the Covered Code under Your choice of the IDPL or the alternative licenses, if any, 
specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
